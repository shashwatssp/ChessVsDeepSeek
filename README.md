## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/shashwatssp/chessvsdeepseek.git
    cd chessvsdeepseek
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    You need to configure Firebase and the DeepSeek API key. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following variables:

    ```
    # Firebase Configuration (Get these from your Firebase project console)
    VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY
    VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=YOUR_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
    VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
    VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=YOUR_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
    VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
    VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_APP_ID
    VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID # Optional

    # DeepSeek API Key (Get this from your DeepSeek account)
    VITE_DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=YOUR_DEEPSEEK_API_KEY
    ```
    **Important:** Do *not* commit your `.env` file to Git. Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file if it's not already there.

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

5.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified by Vite).

## 🔧 Building for Production
